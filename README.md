## Name: Monika D
## Problem Title
E-Waste Facility Locator
## Problem Description
Website that tells you the location of the nearest e-waste collection and recycling facility. Offers educational pop-ups on the harmful components of your e-waste and their effects on the environment and human health if not disposed correctly. There could be an option to input the model of your old device and earn credit points relative to the amount of precious metals recovered from the device if disposed correctly.

## Idea
~~~
1.Comprehensive Device Coverage Inclusion of various electronic devices such as smartphones, laptops, accessories, televisions, refrigerators, and washing machines within the system's scope.
2.User Registration and Authentication: Implementation of a user registration system to enable individuals and businesses to create accounts, track their recycling history, and ensure a secure and personalized experience.
3.Booking and Pickup System: Development of a user-friendly booking system that allows users to schedule pickups for their electronic devices. The system should facilitate convenient and efficient pickup logistics.
4.Rules and Regulations Repository: Creation of a section providing users with information about rules and regulations related to e-waste management. This ensures that users are informed and compliant with relevant legal frameworks.
5.Integration with Recycling Facilities: Collaboration with recycling facilities or service providers to establish a seamless integration, ensuring coordinated pickup processes and effective recycling of electronic devices.
